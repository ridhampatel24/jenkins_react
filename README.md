# React App Deployment on ECS with Continuous Delivery Pipeline

This project demonstrates the deployment of a React app on ECS (Elastic Container Service) using a Continuous Delivery pipeline. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

## Steps:

1. **Testing and Analysis:**

   - Code is thoroughly tested and analyzed using SonarQube.

2. **Continuous Delivery Pipeline Setup:**

   - Utilizing Jenkins, a Continuous Delivery pipeline is established.

3. **Pipeline Workflow:**

   - The pipeline workflow includes the following stages:
     - Fetching code from GitHub.
     - Performing SonarQube analysis.
     - Creating a multistage Docker image.
     - Uploading the Docker image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
     - Successfully deploying the app on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).

4. **Integration with Slack:**
   - Slack notifications are integrated into the Jenkins pipeline to provide real-time updates on the deployment process.

## Workflow Details:

1. **Code Fetching:**

   - The latest code is fetched from the GitHub repository.

2. **SonarQube Analysis:**

   - The code undergoes analysis using SonarQube to ensure code quality and security.

3. **Docker Image Creation:**

   - A multistage Docker image is created, ensuring efficient and reliable packaging of the application.

4. **ECR Image Upload:**

   - The Docker image is uploaded to the AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), providing a secure and scalable storage solution for container images.

5. **ECS Deployment:**

   - The application is deployed on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), leveraging its capabilities for managing and scaling containerized applications.

6. **Slack Notifications:**
   - Slack notifications are sent throughout the pipeline to keep stakeholders informed about the deployment progress and any potential issues.

## Getting Started:

To set up a similar deployment pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have access to Jenkins and SonarQube for code analysis.
2. Set up AWS credentials for Jenkins to interact with AWS services like ECR and ECS.
3. Configure Jenkins to integrate with Slack for notifications.
4. Define your pipeline stages and scripts accordingly to match your deployment process.

With this setup, you can automate the deployment of your React app on ECS with confidence, knowing that each step is thoroughly tested and monitored. Happy deploying! ðŸš€
